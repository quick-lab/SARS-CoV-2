# Creating v5.2.0

To upgrade to v5.2.0 from v5.0.0, via spike in. 

All new primers (delta_rebalance) are pooled to produce 100uL of each Δpool, and then 7.294uL of Δpool 1 and 3.6uL of Δpool 2, are added to 50uL of each v5.0.0 pool.

This is the temporary method while production of v5.2.0 is confirmed with IDT.

Additional [spike-ins](400/v5.2.0_400/add.primer.bed) in v5.2.0 vs v5.1.0 restore functionality for BE.1.1 (including BQ.1), and more generally sequences with a mutation in the region S:454-S:463.
